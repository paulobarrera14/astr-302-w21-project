# astr-302-w21-project
My Final Project using ipywidgets to make two notebooks in the Einsteinpy package more interactive.
The two notebooks I chose were "Shadow cast by an thin emission disk around a Schwarzschild Black Hole" and "Plotting Spacial Hypersurface Embedding for Schwarzschild Space-Time"

This project was a final for Dr. Mario Jurics Astro 302 Class.
